# CSCI640 Inquiry Based Project - Distributed Databases

## Goals
This project has the following goals:

* Project sets out to answer a question about distributed databases
* Students find a survey of research work as the starting point of their project
* Students devise a way to test and/or gain understanding about the question they are trying to ask through a hands on implementation of the concept.
    * Should come up with a procedure or method for testing the effectiveness of known solutions or their solutions.
* Students present their findings to the class
* Students write up a document with their findings

## Sample Questions

Recommended questions, you are welcome to propose a different one. If you did an inquiry based project in one of my classes you can not answer the same question. Any new question needs approval first.

* How does one distributed database stack up to another
   * Example: Comparing table creation, insertion, query, removal, and drops 


### Distributed Databases

You aren't limited to the following; however, you need to choose at least 2 different systems to deploy and compare.

* [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#quickstart_fully_distributed)
    * For additional references in case the official docs aren't enough:
        * [HBase on 3 nodes StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29397659/hbase-installation-in-three-node-hadoop-cluster)
* [RQLite](https://rqlite.io/docs/quick-start/)
    * For additional references in case the official docs aren't enough:
        * [RQLite Cluster Management](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/CLUSTER_MGMT.md)



## Teams

You can work in a team of two to setup your test environment and help each other troubleshoot technical problems. Each team member will have their own unique question, develop their own testing code/methodology/etc, and submit their own lab report of their results.

## Evaluation

Your project will be graded based on the following components.

* Papers - You will need to find a minimum of 2 papers that relate to your topic beyond ones from class or try to solve the question you are wanting to answer. These cannot all come from the same research group/team/author. Also need to be in addition to papers provided in class.
* Presentation - You will need to give a short 5 minute presentation to the class on what you were trying to answer, how you tested, and what findings you discovered
* Paper - You will submit a short paper describing what you were trying to answer, how you tested it, the testing results, and what you learned from these results. This will be in the form of a *pdf*.
    * What is your question
    * Your experimental setup (machines, etc)
        * Are there any side effects or artifacts related to your experimental setup that might impact your results?
        * Who you worked with, if anyone, to help setup this environment
    * How you ran your tests to answer your question
    * Test results:
        * How accurate are they?
            * Make sure you run enough tests that your results are accurate enough.
        * Do you have variation in your testing?
    * Your conclusion/answer to the question
    * What you learned from answering the question
    * References to your papers and other references
* Code - Any code you used for testing in the process of your inquiry used as part of the evaulation in the submitted paper.

### Submission

Submit your *pdf* to Canvas, and commit any code, extra files, data appendixes, etc to your [CSCI640 Repo](https://github.com/CSUChico-CSCI640) on branch ***database***.
