# CSCI640 Group Project

## Goals
This project has the following goals:

* Project sets out to answer a question about a topic related to Operating System Concepts
* Students find a survey of research work as the starting point of their project
* Students devise a way to test and/or gain understanding about the question they are trying to ask through a hands on implementation of the concept.
	* Should come up with a procedure or method for testing the effectiveness of known solutions or their solutions.
* Students present their findings to the class
* Students write up a document with their findings

## Sample Questions
Recommended questions, you are welcome to propose a different one but these ideas that have been done in the past. If you did an inquiry based project in CSCI340 you can not answer the same question. 

* How does the performance of threads in C compare to two of the following languages?
	* Python
	* Rust
	* Go
	* Java
	* Other 
* What file system performs best for small files on Linux? Or alternatively what about for large files? (using IOzone, bonnie++, or dd for benchmarks) 
	* Consider at least 5 of the following filesystems:
		* ext4
		* ext2
		* xfs
		* FAT32
		* ZFS
		* BTFS
		* NTFS (might be CIFS under linux)
* How does the performance of differing IPC mechanisms compare in C to two of the following languages?
	* Python
	* Rust
	* Go
	* Java
	* Other 
* How much does Docker virtualization impact the performance of threads compared to a native system in two of the following languages?
	* C
	* Python
	* Rust
	* Go
	* Java
	* Other 


## Evaluation

Your project will be graded based on the following components.

* Proposal - You need to submit a proposal with the following:
	* Question or topic you want to know more about
	* How you will answer the question/test your understanding
	* This should be emailed to me as a *pdf*
* Papers - You will need to find a minimum of 4 papers that relate to your topic or try to solve the question you are wanting to answer. These cannot all come from the same research group/team.
* Presentation - You will need to give a short 5-10 minute presentation to the class on what you were trying to answer, how you tested, and what findings you discovered
* Periodic Check in - We will have a number of class sessions set aside to provide help with your projects but additionally there will be a google form you will fill out on these dates indicating your progress on your project.
* Paper - You will submit a short paper describing what you were trying to answer, how you tested it, the testing results, and what you learned from these results.
